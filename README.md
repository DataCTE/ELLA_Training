###ELLA Training Fine-tuning Project

Introduction
This project is a result of our efforts to reverse engineer the ELLA training process for version 1.5. We have successfully created a fine-tuned model based on the ELLA architecture. Our goal is to adapt the training script to work with SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL) and make it accessible to the community.

Background:

We were disappointed to learn that the original creators of ELLA did not release the training code for version SDXL. However, instead of waiting for an official release, we decided to take matters into our own hands and reverse engineer the training process ourselves.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

model.py: The implementation of the ELLA model architecture.
train.py: The script for fine-tuning the ELLA model.
requirements.txt: The list of required dependencies for running the project.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DataCTE/ELLA_Training.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd ELLA_Training
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
To fine-tune the ELLA model, run the following command:


```
python train.py
```
Make sure to adjust the training parameters and dataset paths in the train.py script according to your requirements.

Adapting to SDXL
We are actively working on adapting the training script to work with SDXL. Our goal is to leverage the powerful capabilities of SDXL and enhance the fine-tuning process. Stay tuned for updates on this front.
